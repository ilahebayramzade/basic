By the way, I would like to share one of my memories and I think this is really ${adjective1}. One day, I went to the ${where} at 2:00 AM and I saw ${person} here, and when that person saw me, said that you are my ${color} ${animal}. I was shocked; then we talked about ${noun2} for ${number2} hours. Finally, I came back home. Besides, another fact about me is <I love to ${verb}>, but no one knows this because I don't say it to anyone. To go to ${place} is my dream. That is why I will buy ${adjective2} ${noun3}. That's all.`;

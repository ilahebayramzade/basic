Madlib Game 🎉

This project is a simple "Madlib game" written in Python. The main goal was to have fun and develop basic programming skills. I created the project when I was just starting out. 😊

📋 About the Project
- What is Madlib?: It is a game that consists of creating interesting and fun sentences by adding appropriate words to the gaps.
- Python Code: The logic and functions of the game are written in Python.
- HTML Visual: I used an HTML file through AI to add a simple interface.

💻 How Does It Work?
1. Run the Python script from the terminal.
2. Enter words (e.g. noun, adjective, verb).
3. See the result with a fun sentence!

🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x must be installed.
